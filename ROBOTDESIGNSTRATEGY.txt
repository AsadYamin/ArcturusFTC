Robot Design
--------------
4 Wheel Intake Mechanism; 2 in the front and 2 in the back to eject
	-Intake must be upside down or rotate while going up
-------------------------------------
To Hold and Transfer Cryptographs - F Design
	F Design: (Pinned Messages in FTC CHAT on Discord)
	Deposit cryptographs at 45 deg. angle (obviously)
-------------------------------------
Bar On Side with Color Sensor for Jewels (drops and goes back up)
--------------------------------------
ROBOT STRATEGY
	Autonomous:
		Set cryptograph in front of bot, suck crytograph in while moving forward, deposit cryptograph and park
		Jewels: just fling bar down; get color; if color is ours: move back. if color is not ours: move forward.
		Parking: everything is in a set path in the code so we just code it in the movement path.

	Driver Controlled Strategy:
		Suck in two cryptographs, deposit. Place accordingly to the first cryptograph we did in autonomous (out of the remaining possible combinations)
			Once We get to relic; we have a extendable bar delivery system to reach the farthest rectangle and deposit it straight up
	
		Balancing at the End:
			Experiment and find the point in which the robot balances. Position the robot in the center of one side and start to go forward. Reach the point mentioned.

Mecanum Code: 
double r = Math.hypot(gamepad1.left_stick_x, gamepad1.left_stick_y); double robotAngle = Math.atan2(gamepad1.left_stick_y, gamepad1.left_stick_x) - Math.PI / 4; double rightX = gamepad1.right_stick_x; final double v1 = r * Math.cos(robotAngle) + rightX; final double v2 = r * Math.sin(robotAngle) - rightX; final double v3 = r * Math.sin(robotAngle) + rightX; final double v4 = r * Math.cos(robotAngle) - rightX; leftFront.setPower(v1); rightFront.setPower(v2); leftRear.setPower(v3) rightRear.setPower(v4);
